            Hello everyone!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This is a 480-card cube featuring mostly custom cards with "weird" archetypes. 
            The custom cards represent archetypes that aren't well-defined in "real" Magic, 
            while the "reprints" are the simple, tried-and-true, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" staples.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The cube is a journey through Magic, with many "what ifs," references, nostalgia, and surprises. 
            My goal is to evoke those "Wow, I love this!" reactions. ðŸ˜‰

            <li><strong>WU - Storm:</strong> Cast multiple spells in a turn to trigger powerful effects.</li>

            <li><strong>RG - Control:</strong> An unusual take on control using red and green to dominate the board.</li>
            <li><strong>GW - Vehicles:</strong> Crew powerful artifact vehicles with your creatures for strong attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>WB - Blink/ETB/Value:</strong> Flicker creatures in and out of the battlefield to accumulate triggers.</li>
            <li><strong>BG - Artifacts:</strong> Leverage artifacts for value and synergy in an unusual color combination.</li>
            <li><strong>UR - Enchantments:</strong> Use enchantments to control the game and generate value over time.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Keynotes</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>I aim for an unpowered levelâ€”synergy and making the cool cards work together is more important than winning on turn 1-2.</li>
            <li>Custom cards have a rarity symbol that reflects where they might fit in a "Modern Horizons"-style set. If you see a cracked "common," it's not from a typical set, but rarity doesn't impact at all; each card appears only once.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of A.I.-generated art, but I'm not a fan. If you have fitting art or are interested in creating some for me (paid), I'd love to talk!</li>
          </ul>
